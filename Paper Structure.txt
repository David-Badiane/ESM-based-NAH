IMRaD:


-Introduction: 'what' and 'so what' -> what is the paper about

	the content of the paper must match the scope of the journal
	it must present novel results

	starts with general and move to the specific -> three phase:
		-establish a territory
		-establish a niche (indicate a gap)
		-occupy the niche (outline the purpose)
	
	can be also topic -> problem -> solution



-Method (experiment, theory, design, model): -> how the results are generated, and they can be reproducible 
						for a reasearcher in the same field (for validation) and also judge

	not step by step but reference to previous pubblication that allow to achieve the validation (for external validity)
	
	must justify the experimental design

	WARNING! -> NOT  including results in the Method section
		    NOT  including extraneous details
      		    NOT treating the method as a chronological history	of what happened




-Result: -> very short, only a presentation of the results, organized to make them accessible to the reader

	WARNING! -> clearly show the novel results and clearly citing the results previously achieved



-Discussion: -> inverts the format of the introduction, moving from the specific

	WARNING! -> NOT  presenting results that are never discussed
		    NOT presenting discussion that does not relate to any of the results,
                    NOT presenting results and discussion in chronological order rather than logical order, NOT ignoring results that do not support the conclusions



-Conclusion: -> the implications of the findings should be emphasized, explaining how the work is significant


	should allow for opportunistic reading -> imagine a reader who reads the introduction, skims through the figures, then jumps to the conclusion. 
	The conclusion should concisely provide the key message(s) the author wishes to convey

	provide a future perspective on the work, A small amount of speculation can be appropriate here, so long as it is relevant and clearly labeled as speculative

	WARNING! -> NOT do a list of all the things that “I” or “we” have accomplished
		    NOT repeat the abstract and background information from the introduction
	            NOT repeat the arguments made in the results and discussion, only the final and most general conclusions
		    NOT introducing new evidence or new arguments not found in the results and discussion
